===

## Submission Instructions
  * **If you do not include links in your README to online resources you utilized, you will get a 0.**
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork called `lab-33`
  * Submit a pull request to your repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Set up Travis CI and update your repo to utilize the [Travis CI Github app](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci). *Use the free instsallation.*
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on Canvas  

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
* Refer to the [backend lab scaffold template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/tree/master/00-BACKEND-lab-scaffold-template).

#### Feature Tasks 
* Research and implement three sorting algorithms in Javascript. Refer to [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) on various algorithms
   * There are LOTS of resources out there in Javascript about these topics. One of the great ones is [Visual Algo](https://visualgo.net/bn/sorting) for visualizations of how the algorithm works. 
   * You should definitely rely on these resources, **BUT DO NOT BLATANTLY COPY/PASTE CODE THAT YOU FIND ONLINE**
   * Write comments in your code on what each line is doing so it is clear you made a concerted effort you tried to understand it

#### Tests
* Write three test assertions for each sorting algorithm 
 
#### Documentation
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README (even if your build is failing), and include the following information for each algorithm:
  * The name of your sorting algorithm
  * The Big Oh space and run time complexity of your algorithm
  * Whether the algorithm is stable or unstable
  * A good use case for when this is the preferred algorithm to use over others, if applicable
  * Links to sources you used to research the algorithms
  
### Stretch Goal
* Take one of the sorting algorithms you wrote and utilize it to sort the data in your React-Redux budget tracker app according to the cost of your expenses.
